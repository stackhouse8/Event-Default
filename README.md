# Event-Default

As an Event Default user,

WHEN I open the application,
THEN I am able to view a list of options including: Create Event and View Events.
WHEN I select “create event”
THEN I am taken to a post form where I can input: Event Name, Host Name, Time and Date, and Location.
WHEN I select “view events”
THEN I am taken to a page where I can view events.
WHEN I am viewing events and I select “filter events”
THEN I can choose what type of events I want to see displayed.
